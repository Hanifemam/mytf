# mytf — A Minimal Deep Learning Library using TensorFlow

## 🔍 Purpose

`mytf` is a handcrafted deep learning library built using TensorFlow. This project is designed for **learning and educational purposes**, with the following goals:

- 📚 Deepen understanding of **deep learning fundamentals**
- 🧠 Gain hands-on experience with **TensorFlow’s low-level APIs**
- 🧱 Learn to design, build, and maintain a **modular machine learning library**
- 🔧 Practice core **software engineering** principles including testing, documentation, and version control

## 🚧 Project Status

Currently under active development. The project will grow progressively, starting from scratch and implementing:

- Custom layers (e.g. Linear, ReLU)
- Loss functions (e.g. MSE, CrossEntropy)
- Optimizers (e.g. SGD, Adam)
- Neural network building and training pipeline
- Example models (e.g. regression, classification)
- Utilities for data, training, and evaluation
- Unit testing and documentation

Each module will be implemented manually using low-level TensorFlow operations — no Keras.
